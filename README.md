# Happy 24th Birthday Vicky! ðŸŽ‚
Wow you're so old now! 

I wanted to make your birthday a little extra special, so I've collected _almost every_ Daily fact I have sent to you!

I thought that you might appreciate it since you like daily facts so much.

This thing _doesn't_ generate new daily facts though, so you're going to need to keep talking to me for those!

BTW, please *read the code* to make sure I'm not hacking you :)

# Installation / Compilation
If you have never used GitHub before, first click on the green 'code' button, then click on the 'Download ZIP' button.

After downloading, unzip the file. Then proceed to compile the .c file.

I'm sure you know how to compile a .c file... right?
```
gcc dailyfactrepository.c â€“o dailyfactrepository
```
and then...

```
 ./dailyfactrepository
```
