# Happy 24th Birthday Vicky! ðŸŽ‚
## A personal note
Wow you're so old now! 

This year, I wanted to make your birthday a little extra special, so in this C program, I have collected _almost every_ Daily fact I have _ever_ sent to you!

I thought that you might appreciate it, since you like daily facts so much.

I do want to note that this program _doesn't_ generate new daily facts. You're going to need to keep talking to me for those!

BTW, please *read the code*, there might be, idk some cool code for you in there.

## Installation / Compilation
1. Click on the green '<> Code' button
2. Click on the 'Download ZIP' button.
3. Unzip the downloaded file
4. I'm sure you know how to compile a .c file... right?
```
gcc dailyfactrepository.c â€“o dailyfactrepository
```
5. and then...
```
 ./dailyfactrepository
```

## Potential bug
There is potential for the program to encounter a bug on windows... (I programed on Mac).

Let me know if there any problems and I'll push the fix ASAP.
