# Happy 24th Birthday Vicky! ðŸŽ‚
Wow you're so old now! 

This year, I wanted to make your birthday a little extra special, so in this C program, I have collected _almost every_ Daily fact I have _ever_ sent to you!

I thought that you might appreciate it since it seems you like daily facts so much.

I do want to note that this program _doesn't_ generate new daily facts. You're going to need to keep talking to me for those!

BTW, please *read the code*, there might be, idk some cool code for you in there.

# Installation / Compilation
If you have never used GitHub before, first click on the green '<> Code' button, then click on the 'Download ZIP' button.

After downloading, unzip the file. Then proceed to compile the .c file.

I'm sure you know how to compile a .c file... right?
```
gcc dailyfactrepository.c â€“o dailyfactrepository
```
and then...

```
 ./dailyfactrepository
```

# Potential bug
There is potential for the program to encounter a bug on windows... (I programed on Mac).

Let me know if there any problems and I'll push the fix ASAP.
