# Happy 24th Birthday Vicky!
I have prepared for you a repository of _almost every_ Daily fact I've sent to you!

I thought that you might appreciate this half-joke half-thoughtful repository.

The catch? Well you're going to need a C compiler :)

And also C is quite a low level language... please *read the code* to make sure I'm not hacking you!

# Installation / Compilation
```
 $ gcc filename.c â€“o dailyfactrepository

 ./dailyfactrepository
```
